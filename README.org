This server will be an apparatus for better managing my personal projects. It
sits near the idea-generation and idea-translation components of my workflow. It
will be responsible for storing my work as a remote repository, transporting the
work between local development machines, and as a web server to improve the ease
of access of my work, both for myself and anybody curious.

Alternatively put, this is an experiment in [[https://bytes.zone/posts/clown-computing/][Clown Computing]] ðŸ¤¡

Let's hope it works well!

* Setup

I'm using Hetnezer as a host. Their value for money with VPS offerings is pretty
alluring.

Additionally I've found a handy [[https://ayats.org/blog/deploy-rs-example/][blog post]] about =deploy-rs= on Hetzner, which is
remarkably convenient. They were even kind enough to link to a [[https://github.com/viperML/deploy-rs-example][repo]] which I've
shamelessly used as a starting point.

Unfortunately, Hetnezer doesn't offer a NixOS image, but they do allow you to
mount a NixOS install volume (22.05 as of writing) to your server after creating
it. After doing so, starting the VM we can get it set up simply with:

#+begin_src shell
sudo -s
nix-shell -p git
git clone https://github.com/tecosaur/golgi
cd golgi
./install.sh
# wait a bit, then create root password
shutdown -h now
#+end_src

* Deploying

Deploying is simply a matter of entering the deploy nix shell =nix develop= and
=deploy .#golgi.system=.

In order for this image to be built, the sandbox will need to be set to =false= or
=relaxed= (for the custom zsh and Caddy builds). This can  be done by adding the
line ~sandbox = relaxed~ to =/etc/nix/nix.conf=. Just note that the nix-daemon will
need to be restarted for this new setting to take full effect.
