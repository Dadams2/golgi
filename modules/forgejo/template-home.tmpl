        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">
          <p>Git is the foremost
            <abbr title="Distributed Version Control System">DVCS</abbr>, and so
            I consider a distributed
            <abbr title="Forge (software): A web-based collaborative software platform">forge</abbr>
            system very much in keeping with the idea. Furthermore, considering
            the ideals and rationale of the free software movement, it seems
            doubly strange to tie oneself to a centeralised proprietary
            <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> offering like GitHub.</p>
          <p>Here you may find my personal forge. It currently hosts a few
            projects that are mirrored to GitHub, and a few projects I've just got
            here. The long term plan is to essentially move off GitHub, probably
            mirroring major projects for visibility.</p>
          <p>Moving my projects to this single-user forge seems like a strange
            decision if I'm interested in collaboration (I am), but there are three
            approaches that can be taken to make this work:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt><b>Emailing patches</b></dt>
            <dd>The original way of sharing code! ðŸ˜Ž It didn't stop working at any
              point, and it's easy enough for me to review, apply, and push.</dd>
            <dt><b>Redirecting PRs from mirrors</b></dt>
            <dd>I could hypothetically check out a PR to a mirror
              (using <a href="https://magit.vc/manual/forge.html" style="color: var(--color-primary);">Magit's
              Forge</a>) and then simply merge it with the main branch and push
              it to the canonical repository. This is (as of yet) untested
              though âš .</dd>
            <dt><b>ForgeFed</b></dt>
            <dd>I'm wildly excited for
              <a href="https://forgefed.org/" style="color: var(--color-primary);">ForgeFed</a>,
              and soonâ„¢ it should be possible to make PRs <em>across</em> Forgejo
              instances ðŸ¤¯ (and anyone else implementing the ForgeFed protocol).</dd>
