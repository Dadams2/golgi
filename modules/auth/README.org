#+title:  Authentication

This is a lightweight authentication suite from two well-regarded tools:

+ [[https://www.authelia.com/][Authelia]] sits in front of services with OpenID connect
+ [[https://github.com/lldap/lldap][LLDAP]] is a lightweight LDAP user server with a basic user/groups UI

Credit is owed to PopeRigby, who has done some [[https://codeberg.org/PopeRigby/nixos/src/branch/main/systems/x86_64-linux/haddock/services/auth][wonderful work]] setting up these
two components in NixOS. His configuration was instrumental in getting this
working.

* Adding clients

It would be nice to have a random client ID, but that's a bit difficult to work
out. We will be taking the password seriously though, it's not quite as nice but
it should be sufficient.
